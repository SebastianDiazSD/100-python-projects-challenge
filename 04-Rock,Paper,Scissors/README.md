# 🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors

## 🎮 What's This All About?

Welcome to this little Python project, **made with a dash of Colombian sazón**. In this game, you’ll play good ol' Rock, Paper, Scissors — but this time, against your computer. 🖥️

It’s a perfect project for beginners who want to learn the basics of coding while having a bit of fun — like playing at the tienda with your primos, but digital. 😉

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This isn’t just a game, it’s a mini coding class with Colombian flavor

- Use **variables** 🧠
- Make decisions with `if`, `elif`, and `else` (yes, like life choices 🤔)
- Compare values using `==`
- Combine logic with `or` like a true ñero of Python

## 📋 How It Works

Even though this game seems simple, it’s got rules — just like abuela’s house. Here's how it plays out:

### 🏆 The Winning Moves:

- **Rock** smashes **Scissors** 💥  
- **Paper** wraps **Rock** up tight 📄  
- **Scissors** slice **Paper** clean ✂️  

Each round:
1. You make your move.
2. The computer picks its own.
3. A winner is chosen.
4. You decide: play again or bail out (no shame in that, llave).
