# 🎬 Top 10 Movies – Web Scraping + HTML/CSS  
**Project #43 of my 100 Python Projects Challenge**

Welcome to a project made with Python, BeautifulSoup, and a good dose of Colombian flavor 🟡🔵🔴.  
This mini web project scrapes the **top-rated films from Letterboxd**, selects the best 10, and displays them in a clean, elegant webpage.

Yes, we scrape data.  
Yes, we create a website with it.  
And yes… we do it with style.  
Parce, así trabajamos en Colombia. 🇨🇴🔥

## 🐍 Personal Note
I’m doing the 100 Python Projects Challenge to grow as a developer —
and I want to do it with the same energy we Colombians bring:

* passion
* discipline
* creativity
* a little sabor latino 🌶️

If this inspires you, then the repo already did its job.
