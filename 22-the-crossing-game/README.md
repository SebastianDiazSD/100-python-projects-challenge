# 🐾 Crossing the Street 🐾
**A simple Frogger-style Python game**

This is a classic arcade-style game built using Python’s `turtle` module. The goal? Help **Dante the dog** cross a busy street without getting hit by the cars. Each time you make it across, the game gets a little faster and more intense.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to move Dante.
- Avoid the cars zooming by on the road.
- Reach the top to level up!
- Get hit by a car? You’ll get a score popup and the option to try again.
- Your highest score is saved locally. Be a legend 🏆
