# Python Debugging Project: "Fixing Errors with Colombian Flare"

## Overview

This project is about debugging and improving Python code. The goal is to help developers understand common errors and how to fix them. I will guide you through both the **incorrect** and **correct** versions of each code snippet, with explanations of what went wrong and how I fixed it.

## Project Structure

1. **Wrong Version** - A snippet with errors or issues.
2. **Correct Version** - A fixed and more user-friendly version of the code.
3. **Explanations** - Clear explanations for each fix, focused on user-friendly messages and logic.
