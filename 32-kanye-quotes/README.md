# 🎤 Kanye Says... (Project #32 of 100 Python Projects)

> “Yo, I’m gonna let you finish, but this app has some of the best Tkinter vibes of all time.” — Kanye West (probably)

A simple yet stylish Python app built with **Tkinter** that displays random Kanye West quotes using the [Kanye REST API](https://kanye.rest).  

Because sometimes, even in Bogotá, Medellín, or Cali, you need a little Kanye energy to keep your motivation high. 💪🇨🇴
