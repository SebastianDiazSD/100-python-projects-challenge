# ☕ My Colombian Coffee Machine (Now with OOP Power)

¡Hola! 👋 I'm excited to share this project with you.

This coffee machine started as a simple Python exercise—a way to learn how to build something fun while practicing core programming concepts. As a proud Colombian and a lover of great coffee, it made total sense to create a virtual coffee machine. ☕🇨🇴

That first version worked well, but now is better!

This new version is a personal refactor of my original project, now built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Same vibe. Same coffee. But the code? Much more organized, reusable, and scalable.

---

## 🚀 What’s New?

✅ Refactored the entire coffee machine to use OOP  
✅ Split logic into clear, clean classes: `Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`  
✅ More maintainable and future-ready code  
✅ Still full of Colombian flavor and personality 😉

---

## ☕ What Can You Do With It?

Run the machine, grab your virtual coffee, and interact with a system that:

- Offers you a menu of Colombian-style drinks 🍫
- Checks if there are enough resources to make your coffee 🌊🥛☕
- Asks you to pay with virtual coins (and gives change if needed) 💰
- Uses classes to handle everything cleanly and clearly 🧼

## 🖥️ How to Run It

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SebastianDiazSD/100-python-projects-challenge.git
   cd 16-coffee-machine-oop
   ```

2. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧱 How It’s Structured (Classes Breakdown)

- Menu: Holds all available drinks, each with its ingredients and cost.
- MenuItem: A single drink item with its own properties.
- CoffeeMaker: Handles all resources and makes sure we have enough to brew.
- MoneyMachine: Manages coins, payments, and profit.
- main.py: The control center where everything comes together.

This setup makes the project easier to expand in the future. If I ever want to add more drinks or new features, it's just a matter of extending a class or adding a new one.
