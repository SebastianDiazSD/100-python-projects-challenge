Sebastian’s Recipe for Traditional Colombian Buñuelos

Ingredients

For the dough:

1 cup cassava starch (almidón de yuca)
1 cup costeño cheese, grated
1 egg
3 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp milk
1 pinch of salt


For frying:

Vegetable oil (enough for deep frying)


Instructions

Mix the cassava starch, cheese, sugar, and salt in a bowl.
Add the egg and milk, then combine until a smooth dough forms.
Roll small balls of dough with your hands.
Heat the oil on medium-low — buñuelos need slow heat so they don’t burst!
Fry until golden brown and perfectly round.
Remove and let cool slightly. Enjoy with hot chocolate like a true Colombian!
