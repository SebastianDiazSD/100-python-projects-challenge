**Debugging Practice**

Look at the code in the code editor. There are errors on all 5 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
Try to run the code and debug each line using the error messages and feedback.

**Fix the code below** 👇

```python 
print(Notes from Day 1")
 print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters"
priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
```
**Error messages**

- SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
- IndentationError: unexpected indent
- SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
- NameError: name 'priint' is not defined. Did you mean: 'print'?
- SyntaxError: '(' was never closed
