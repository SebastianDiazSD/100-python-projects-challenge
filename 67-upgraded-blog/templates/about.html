        <p>
          I am a Civil Engineer with a strong background in construction
          management and railway project supervision. My experience includes
          overseeing infrastructure development, coordinating multidisciplinary
          teams, and ensuring technical excellence in complex environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I developed a growing interest in technology and digital
          systems. Today, my goal is to fuse computer science with civil
          engineering to create smarter, data-driven solutions for railway
          infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the future of infrastructure lies at the intersection of
          engineering and software — where precision meets innovation, and
          projects are optimized through intelligent systems.
        </p>
