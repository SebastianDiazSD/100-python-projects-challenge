# 🇨🇴 Flask Calculator App – Introduction to Flask

Welcome, parcero 👋  
This project is part of my **100 Challenges Python journey**, where I’m building real, functional applications while learning modern Python tools.

This app is a **beginner-friendly Flask web application** that introduces:
- Flask routing
- HTML forms
- User input handling
- Basic backend logic

All done **with patience, clean code, and a Colombian touch** — aquí lo hacemos con calma y buena práctica.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Flask app presents a simple homepage where users can:

- Choose a mathematical operation:
  - Add
  - Subtract
  - Multiply
  - Divide
- Input two numbers
- Get the result instantly

The goal is not just to calculate, but to **understand how Flask connects Python logic with a web interface**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **HTML (rendered with Flask)**
- Minimal inline CSS for styling

No heavy frameworks — just the essentials, mi viejo.

## 📌 Key Learnings

Through this project, I practiced:

* Flask app initialization
* Routing with @app.route
* Handling GET and POST requests
* Processing form data with request.form
* Structuring a clean beginner Flask project

Little by little, Paso a paso con paciencia, things start to click.
