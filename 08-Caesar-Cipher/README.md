# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Edition 🇨🇴

Hey! Welcome to this little cryptography project made with 💛 Python and a bit of Colombian flavour.  
Here, we’re bringing back a classic: the **Caesar Cipher** — one of the most old-school (and cool) encryption techniques out there.

## 🧠 What's a Caesar Cipher?

In simple terms, it’s a way to **hide your message** by shifting the letters of the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of 3 to the right:

- A -> D
- B -> E
- C -> F
- D -> G

This method was used by Julius Caesar himself (yep, the Roman man) to keep his messages private. Pretty clever for ancient times, no?

To decrypt the message, we just do the opposite — shift to the left.

## 🚀 How This Program Works

We built this project step-by-step, based on a **flowchart** and a bunch of easy-to-follow TODOs.

### 💡 Features

- The user chooses whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a message.
- You provide the **cipher key** (the shift number).
- After finishing, the program **asks if you want to run it again** (por si quieres seguir jugando).

### Example

Welcome to Caesar Cipher! 🔐

Type 'encode' to encrypt, 'decode' to decrypt: encode
What's your message?: hello
Type the shift number: 3

Here's the encoded result: khoor
Do you want to run the Cipher again? Type 'Yes' or 'No': no
Pana! Thank you very much for using our Cipher program
