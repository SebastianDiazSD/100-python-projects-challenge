# 📱 Higher or Lower: Instagram Edition

Hey there! 👋 I built this fun little project called **Higher or Lower: Instagram Edition**.

It's a simple game where you guess which celebrity has more followers on Instagram. That’s it. Super easy to play, but harder than you think!

## 🎮 How It Works

- The game starts by showing you **two celebrities**.
- You guess who has **more followers** by typing `'A'` or `'B'`.
- If you’re right, your score goes up and you keep playing. The winner stays and faces a new challenger.
- If you’re wrong, the game ends — but don’t worry, you can play again!

It’s all about your gut feeling... and maybe spending too much time on social media 😅

## 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted to build something **fun, quick, and interactive** while practicing Python. I also wanted to work with:

- Dictionaries
- Random selection
- While loops & conditionals
- Clean UI in the terminal (using ASCII art for fun!)
- Writing reusable functions

Plus, I wanted to make something that my friends could actually enjoy playing, not just a boring script sitting in a folder.

## 🚀 How To Run It

Make sure you have Python installed, then clone this repo and run the game:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SebastianDiazSD/100-python-projects-challenge.git
cd higher-lower-instagram
python higher_lower_game.py
```

You’ll also need:

```bash
game_data.py → Contains the list of celebs and their follower counts.
art.py → Just some ASCII art for the logo and the VS graphic.
```

## 🛠 Files Breakdown

```bash
main.py – The heart of the game.
game_data.py – List of celebs, their descriptions, countries, and follower counts.
art.py – Just for fun visuals to make it feel more like a real game.
README.md – This file, telling you the whole cuento.
```
