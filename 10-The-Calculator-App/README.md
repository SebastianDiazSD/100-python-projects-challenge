# 🧮 My First Calculator in Python — Made with Colombian Flavor 🇨🇴

Hey there! 👋

Let me tell you a quick story.

I'm currently learning Python, and I wanted to build something simple — but not *too* simple — to practice what I’ve been learning. So I thought to myself:

> “Parce, what’s something useful, easy to test, and fun to make?”

A **calculator**, of course. But not just any calculator — this one has **personality**. It’s friendly, it talks to you, and it has that warm Colombian touch. ☕✨

This little project helped me understand how to use functions, loops, conditionals, and handle user input in the terminal. And now, I’m sharing it here on GitHub in case it helps someone else on their coding journey.

## 🚀 What It Does

This calculator lets you:

- Add ➕  
- Subtract ➖  
- Multiply ✖️  
- Divide ➗ (and yes, it handles division by zero like a good parcero should)

After every operation, you can:

- Start a fresh calculation
- Keep using the previous result (because who wants to type it all again?)
- Or just say *chao* and exit

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-calculator.git
