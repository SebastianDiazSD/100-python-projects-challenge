# 🇨🇴 39-HTML-Intro — A Colombian Beginner’s Journey Into HTML

**Welcome to my Day 39 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge!**
Today I took my first steps into **web development**, exploring the basics of **HTML** — the structure behind every webpage.

Even though everything is written in English, I added my own **Colombian touch** throughout the exercises. After all, learning is more fun when it feels close to home. 🌞
