# Python Quiz Game 🎮🐍

Hey there! 👋  

This is my little **Python quiz game project**. I created it to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, classes, and basic Python skills while having some fun. It's simple, interactive, and totally beginner-friendly.

## About the Game

- The quiz asks **True/False questions** from a pool of fun and weird facts.  
- You can track your **score** as you go.  
- Questions include animals, science, weird trivia, and even a bit of Colombia flavor 🇨🇴.

## How it Works

The project is divided into four files:

1. **`data.py`** – contains all the quiz questions and answers.
2. **`question_model.py`** – defines the `Question` class.
3. **`quiz_brain.py`** – handles the quiz logic, asking questions, and checking answers.
4. **`main.py`** – the main file to run the game.

I also added **randomized question order** to keep it exciting every time you play! 🎲
