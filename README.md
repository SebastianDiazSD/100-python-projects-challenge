# 100 Python Projects Challenge 🚀🐍

¡Hola! 👋 I'm on a mission to **learn Python by doing**, and this repository is where I'm documenting every step of the way.

I started this **100 Python Projects Challenge** not just to learn syntax or follow tutorials, but to *actually build things* — things that solve problems, automate tasks, and even make me smile. Coming from Colombia, where resourcefulness is part of our DNA 🇨🇴, I wanted to mix that same energy into my coding journey.

This is more than just a list of projects — it’s my personal growth log, and you're welcome to follow along, fork it, or even join me.

## 🌟 What I’m Learning Along the Way

By the end of this challenge, I hope to:
- Code fluently in Python 3
- Build automation scripts, games, web apps, GUIs, and data science projects
- Work with cutting-edge tools and libraries used in the industry
- Create a powerful portfolio to showcase to employers

## 💻 Technologies & Tools Covered

Here’s what I’m diving into (and sometimes struggling with 😅)

**Core Python**
- Python 3
- PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

**Automation & Scripting**
- Python Scripting, Selenium, Requests, Beautiful Soup

**Game Development**
- Turtle, Pygame (optional)

**Web Development**
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Flask, REST APIs, WTForms
- SQLite, PostgreSQL
- Authentication, Deployment (Heroku, Gunicorn, GitHub Pages)

**Data Science**
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

**GUI Development**
- Tkinter

**Version Control**
- Git & GitHub

## 📦 Sample Projects

…and **92 more!**

## 🚧 Project Structure

Every project lives in its own folder so it’s easy to explore:
- The actual code (obviously)
- A short `README.md` explaining what it does
- Notes if I learned something cool or hit a wall

Some of these are quick wins. Others made me want to throw my laptop. But every single one has helped me level up.

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

I’m doing this for myself, but if you relate to any of these, you’ll probably enjoy the ride too:

- You’re a beginner who learns best by building
- You’re tired of just watching tutorials and never shipping
- You want to build a solid portfolio with real code
- You love Python, or you're just getting started

## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Wanna Connect or Contribute?

This is an open journey — feel free to fork, follow, or even suggest new project ideas!  
If you’re doing your own version of this challenge, let me know — I’d love to see it and cheer you on.

You can also open a pull request if you want to improve something or help clean up the code. I'm learning, so feedback is always welcome.

## 💬 Final Words

I’m not a pro (yet). I’m learning by doing, Googling like crazy, breaking things, fixing them, and loving every second.

Thanks for stopping by.  
Let’s build cool stuff together.  
Con cariño desde Colombia 🇨🇴
