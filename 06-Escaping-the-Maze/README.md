# 🧠 Karel the Robot: Maze Escape 🇨🇴

¡Quiubo! This project is all about helping our pana **Karel the Robot** find his way out of a tricky maze 🌀. It's not just a game — it's a way to dive deeper into Python while having some fun with **functions**, **while loops**, and **structured code blocks**.

## 🎯 Goal

Karel is stuck in a maze and needs to escape, no matter where he starts or how he's facing. Your mission (and his) is to write Python code that guides him safely to the goal — every single time. No hardcoding allowed, parce 😉

## 🌐 Play the Maze

You can open the maze and try it yourself right here:

👉 [Open Maze in Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)

Make sure to select **Python** as the language, and you’re ready to start coding.

## 🐍 What You'll Learn

This project is perfect if you want to level up your Python game. You’ll get hands-on with:

- `while` loops for continuous decision-making
- `if/else` statements to react to the environment
- Defining and calling **functions** to organize your logic
- Writing **clean, reusable code** like a real pro

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Karel can move, turn, and detect walls.
2. Your code needs to tell him how to navigate the maze logically.
3. No matter where Karel begins or what direction he's facing, the solution should still get him to the goal.

This ain't no one-way ticket. It has to work **every time**, con toda.


## 🤖 About Reeborg

Karel lives in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/), a visual Python learning tool that helps beginners understand how code interacts with environments. It's perfect for learning how to think like a programmer.

## 🧉 Final Thoughts

This is more than just getting to the end — it's about writing smart, flexible code that adapts. And como decimos por aquí: *"El que programa con pasión, nunca está perdido."*

¡Suerte, parcero! Let's get Karel outta there.💻
