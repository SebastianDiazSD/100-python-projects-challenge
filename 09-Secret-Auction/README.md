# 🇨🇴 Secret Auction - Colombian Style 🎉

¡Bienvenidos, parceros y parceras!  
This is a simple yet exciting **Python program** where each bidder enters their offer **in secret**, and in the end, we reveal **who offered the most**. Just like in a real auction... but with that Colombian spice! 🌶️

## 🐍 About the Program

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a **secret auction**:

- Each participant enters their **name** and **bid amount**.
- The screen clears after every entry (so no peeking 👀).
- Once all bids are in, the program reveals the **highest bidder** — loud and proud! 🎤

It's a fun way to practice basic Python concepts like:

- Functions
- Loops
- Dictionaries
- User input
- Screen clearing with `os` module
