# 100 Python Projects - Project 41: Introduction to CSS

This is the solution folder for **Project 41** of the **100 Python Projects** challenge. In this project, you will learn the basics of **CSS** with a Colombian twist! 🇨🇴

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three parts, each designed to teach a different method of styling HTML with CSS. The structure is as follows:

```bash
41-css-intro/
├── 1_Adding_CSS/
│ ├── external.html
│ ├── inline.html
│ ├── internal.html
│ ├── index.html
│ └── style.css
├── 2_CSS_Selectors/
│ ├── index.html
│ └── style.css
└── 3_colour_vocab_website/
├── index.html
└── style.css
```


### 1. **Adding CSS**
This section demonstrates three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file:
- **Inline CSS** (directly within HTML tags)
- **Internal CSS** (within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`)
- **External CSS** (via an external stylesheet)

### 2. **CSS Selectors**
In this section, you will learn how to use various CSS selectors to apply styles:
- **Element selector**: targets elements based on their HTML tag name
- **Class selector**: targets elements based on their class attribute
- **ID selector**: targets elements based on their ID attribute
- **Attribute selector**: targets elements based on attributes and values
- **Universal selector**: targets all elements

### 3. **Color Vocabulary Website**
This project demonstrates how to create a small website to learn colors in Spanish. The page displays different colors in Spanish along with images of each color. You’ll practice using CSS to style the elements and make the website visually appealing.
