## 🎮 What is Blackjack?

Blackjack (also known as 21) is a popular card game where your goal is simple:

> **Get as close to 21 as possible without going over.**

You play against the computer dealer, and the rules follow the traditional Blackjack format.

## 🧠 Game Rules

- Number cards are worth their number (e.g., 4 = 4).
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth **10**.
- Aces are worth **11**, but automatically switch to **1** if you’d go over 21.
- If you go over 21, you lose. No second chances, parce. 😅
- The computer draws until it reaches at least 17.
- Highest score under 21 wins!
